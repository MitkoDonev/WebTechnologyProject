            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><h6>HTML:</h6></a>
            <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
                in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
                languages such as JavaScript.

                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                included cues for the appearance of the document.

                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such
                as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
                documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
                and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as "img/"
                and "input/" directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
                "p" surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
                Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

                HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior
                and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
                Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has
                encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"><h6>CSS:</h6></a>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                alongside HTML and JavaScript.

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
                specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the
                structural content.

                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
                styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
                or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if
                the content is accessed on a mobile device.

                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if
                more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME
                type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
                validation service for CSS documents.

                In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and
                XUL.</p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"><h6>Javascript:</h6></a>
            <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
                ECMAScript specification.JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
                It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
                functions.

                Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.avaScript
                enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of
                websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
                engine to execute it.

                As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
                styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
                expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself
                does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the
                host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.

                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers,
                usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as
                Electron and Cordova.

                Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and
                respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
